<p>Greyjoy's Iron and Ale</p>
<p>Meat does not require planting or harvesting.  So it makes sense that Iron and Ale is in the land of the people
that "Do Not Sow".  Meat and mead is their specialty. Do  not go expecting other options.  Although constrictive due
to their inability to grow crops, their menu features many fantastic options including Theon's Smoked Sausage (A 
recipe created by Ramsey Snow).  Anyone looking to taste the greatest meat in all of Westeros will not be disappointed
at Iron and Ale.

<p>Catelyn's Bistro</p>
<p>Established in the memory of the late Catelyn Stark, Catelyn's Bistro is a small, quaint restuarant located in The Fingers,
on the northeastern shores of the Vale of Arryn.  Run by Petyr Baelish, this establish prides itself on being 
very upscale while still welcoming every walk of life (as long as they can still pay).  Located in a remote part of the Vale, 
Catelyn's Bistro makes well for a romantic rendevous or a quiet dinner.</p>
